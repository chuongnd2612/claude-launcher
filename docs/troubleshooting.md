# Troubleshooting

The failures worth a note, and what to do about them.

[&larr; Back to the README](../README.md)

**Escape sequences printed as text** — the terminal has no VT support. Use Windows Terminal, or
disable "Paint background" in settings for a lighter look.

**Box characters show as `?`** — the console code page is not UTF-8. Windows Terminal handles this
automatically; in legacy hosts run `chcp 65001`.

**Layout check without a terminal** — render every screen as plain text:

```powershell
$env:CLAUDE_LAUNCHER_STATE="$HOME\.claude-launcher\state.json"
& "$HOME\.claude-launcher\ClaudeLauncher.exe" --selftest 132 44
```

**`irm ... | iex` fails with `Unexpected attribute 'CmdletBinding'`** — you are running a cached copy
of the installer from when the file still carried a UTF-8 BOM. `irm` passes the BOM to
`iex` as a literal character, so `param()` is no longer the first statement. Strip it yourself:

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chuongnd2612/claude-launcher/main/install-online.ps1).TrimStart([char]0xFEFF)))
```

**Build fails on restore** — `src/NuGet.config` clears all package sources on purpose (the project
has no dependencies, so the build stays offline-friendly). Delete that file if you add a
`PackageReference`.
